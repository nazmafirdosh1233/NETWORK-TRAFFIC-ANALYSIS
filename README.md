# NETWORK-TRAFFIC-ANALYSIS
             The network traffic analysis of Methasploitable, a purposely vulnerable virtual machine, 
             has provided invaluable insights into the security weaknesses and potential risks within its network infrastructure. 
             By carefully examining the traffic patterns, communication protocols, and interactions between different components, we were able to identify severavulnerabilities 
             that could be exploited by malicious actors. 
             This analysis underscores the importance of regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address weaknesses proactively. 
             By leveraging these findings to patch and fortify the network's defenses, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of potential cyberattacks and protect their critical assets from unauthorized access and data breaches. 
             Additionally, this exercise serves as a valuable learning opportunity for security professionals to understand the intricacies of network security and improve their ability to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.
